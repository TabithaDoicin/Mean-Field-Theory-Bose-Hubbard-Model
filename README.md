Simple Mean-field theory simulation of the Bose-Hubbard model with the aim of capturing the phase diagram.

#dependencies#

Requires Quspin

(It is easiest to get Anaconda, update it thoroughly, and install Quspin and all its own dependencies automatically
using the info here: https://anaconda.org/weinbe58/quspin)

#####USAGE#####

##base system parameters##

U = On-site potential

z = number of nearest neighbours

max_p = maximum number of particles per site

L = Length of chain (currently not in use)

#initialisation of system

EXAMPLE:
##
s = SPSystem(U = 1, z = 4, max_p = 6, L = 1) 
##
's' is the system name in this case, 'SPSystem' is the name of the object

#simulation parameters, and calling the simulation method#

system = s #name of system (a variable in the simulation method)

x = t/U

y = mu/U

xmin = minimum value of x

xmax = maximum value of y

xsteps = resolution of diagram in the x direction

ymin, ymax, ysteps = similar to x case

#simulation of system (includes mechanism for plotting phase diagram)

EXAMPLE:
##
simulate(system = s, xmin = 0, xmax = 0.05, xsteps = 50, 
         ymin = 0, ymax = 3, ysteps = 50) #calling simulate function, does calculations
